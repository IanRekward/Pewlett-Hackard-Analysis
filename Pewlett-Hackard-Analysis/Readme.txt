** Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

** Retirees
In this project we are trying to get an understanding of the departmental and overall impact of an impending wave of retiring baby-boomers to Pewlett Hackard's business operations.


** Deliverable 1
Number of retirees by title

Our hypothesis is that within the full organization there will be many age related retirements within the boomer generation.  We identified 90,398 members of the staff across all departments. Within those we broke these into groups by titles with Senior Engineers making up the majority of projected retirees.  


** Deliverable 2
Mentorship Eligibility

In determining a specific group of staff members for mentorship eligibility, we focused soley on staff members whose birthdays fell between 01/01/1965 and 12/31/1965. This was to build a subgroup with an apriximate age delta of ~10 years between the mentorship eligible group and our potential retirees.
The analysis resulted 1,550 members of the staff that are eligible for the mentorship program with a potential match of mentee. The assumption is that this will yield a balanced number of of mentors to mentees.

all relevant tables are included in the git repository.
